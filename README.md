# bear-fit 🧸🏋️‍♂️

Finding a time that works for more than 2 adult humans is **unbearable**. I hope this helps.

## motivation and alternatives

Doodle was bad, now it's bad and corporate, and my friends didn't like using [crab.fit] on phones, so I made this instead. Ben is a cool guy tho, so please use app if you prefer crabs or want to select hours.

You probably wanna use [cal.com](https://cal.com) if you need something like this at work.
